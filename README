A very hacky fun project to play around with.

It has a CLI which allows users to store, view and edit key-value pairs. The
CLI wraps lib.rs which exposes HTTP verbs get, post, put and delete to operate
on the key-value pairs.

Key-value pairs can undergo a transform operation before being saved to file
and after being loaded from file. Depending upon transform, there can be
different applications. E.g. if transform is encryption then note1 can be used
as a password store.
